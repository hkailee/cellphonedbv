# CellPhoneDBv (CellPhoneDB variant)

## What is CellPhoneDBv?
CellPhoneDBv is an user-improved version of CellPhoneDB - a publicly available repository of curated receptors, ligands and its interactions. Subunit architecture is included for both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. This is crucial, as cell-cell communication relies on multi-subunit protein complexes that go beyond the binary representation used in most databases and studies.

Please refer to [existing repository] (https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb) on how to use the program.
